= Fallback Producer

This is plan B if the MQTT source (https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/4-realtime-api/vehicle-positions/) that is used throughout the hands-on labs does not work. We're using a SQlite3 database with ~1 million records recorded from the MQTT source and play it back in an endless loop.

== Creating the Fallback DB

. Open VS Code in the folder `create-fallback-db`
. Run the application (in debug mode) via menu *Debug->Start Debugging*
. Let it run until at least 1 million records are generated
. Stop the application and exit VS Code

== Creating the Fallback Producer Docker Image

. Navigate to the folder `fallback-producer/producer` and run this command:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
--
$ *docker image build -t cnfltraining/vp-producer-fallback:v2*
--

. Use the image `cnfltraining/vp-producer-fallback:v2` instead of the image `cnfltraining/vp-producer:v2` if the MQTT source does not work.
